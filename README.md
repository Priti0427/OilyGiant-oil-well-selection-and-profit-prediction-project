# OilyGiant-oil-well-selection-and-profit-prediction-project

## Introduction
OilyGiant is planning to invest in new oil well development across three regions. Our goal is to determine the most profitable region by:

- Building a linear regression model to predict oil reserves.

- Selecting the top 200 wells per region based on predicted reserves.

- Calculating expected profits under given business constraints.

- Assessing risks using the Bootstrapping technique.

- Making a data-driven recommendation.

âœ… Assumptions
- Budget: $100 million (to develop 200 wells).

- Revenue per barrel: $4.5K (since reserves are in 1000 barrels).

- Only Linear Regression is permitted.

- Regions: geo_data_0, geo_data_1, geo_data_2.

- Risk of loss must be < 2.5%.
